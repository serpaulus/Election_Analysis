#Analysis of the Election Audit

## Election Audit Overview

This training project’s objective is to create a program for a Colorado Board of Elections to complete an audit on a local congressional election to provide:
1.  The total number of election votes casted
2.  Number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct
3.  County with the largest number of votes
4.  Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received
5.  Winning candidate, with their vote count, and their percentage of the total votes 

## Resources 
1. Election results data in the form of an electronic csv file titled [“election_results.csv”]( https://github.com/serpaulus/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv)
2. Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio 1.38.1

## [Election analysis results]( https://github.com/serpaulus/Election_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt):

County Votes:
- Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
- Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
- Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

Largest County Turnout: Denver

- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

 Winner: Diana DeGette
  - Winning Vote Count: 272,892
  - Winning Percentage: 73.8%


## Election-Audit Summary:

This programing code created for this audit can be used, as is, to process any election data provided in a comma separated (CSV format) as in the [example provided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpaulus/Election_Analysis/main/Resources/election_results.csv). There are virtually no limitations in the number of counties or candidates that can be audited. Additionally, if required, the code can be easily modified to count votes for other elections such as city elections where votes are counted precincts instead of counties, or any other election where voting data can be provided by a unique ID such as ballot number.
